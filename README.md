**`Product Development Engineer | Embedded Systems & Simulation Researcher`**

I'm a Product Development Engineer at Embraer specializing in the virtual integration, modeling and simulation of aircraft systems. At university, I research embedded systems with a focus on signal processing, power electronics, microelectronics, AI/ML and FPGA applications for autonomous vehicles. Iâ€™m dedicated to advancing science and the digital world one step at a time. All my coding projects are built from from scratch, that is initial planning and design through to solving real-world and academic challenges with code.
